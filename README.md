# Python-weather-app
A python weather app template with all the basic functionality.


## Overview

The Weather App is a graphical user interface (GUI) application built using PyQt6 that allows users to select a country and city to fetch and display weather information. The application utilizes the Open Meteo API to retrieve weather data, including temperature and precipitation forecasts.

### Features

- **Country and City Selection**: Users can select a country from a predefined list, which dynamically updates the available cities based on the selected country.
- **Weather Fetching**: Upon selecting a city and clicking the "Get Weather" button, the app fetches the current temperature and precipitation data from the Open Meteo API.
- **User Feedback**: The app provides feedback to the user in case of errors, such as invalid selections or issues with data fetching.

### Code Explanation

- **Imports**: The application imports necessary modules, including `sys`, `requests`, and PyQt6 widgets.
- **Location Mapping**: A dictionary named `locations` maps countries to their respective cities and coordinates (latitude and longitude).
- **WeatherApp Class**: This class defines the main application window, including layout, widgets, and functionality for updating city options and fetching weather data.
- **API Interaction**: The `fetch_weather` method constructs a request URL using the selected city's coordinates and retrieves weather data from the Open Meteo API.

### Responsible API Usage

When using APIs, it is crucial to be responsible and avoid straining the servers. Here are some best practices:

- **Limit Requests**: Avoid making excessive requests in a short period. Implement caching or throttling mechanisms if necessary.
- **Error Handling**: Always handle potential errors gracefully, providing users with informative messages.
- **Respect Rate Limits**: Be aware of the API's rate limits and ensure your application adheres to them to prevent service disruptions.
